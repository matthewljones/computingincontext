### Homework 3: final mini-project

Due May 7, 5pm

Your task is this: data exploration using a data set of your choice. The goal is to use the tools you've been learning to explore the data set to set up theses and observations that you could go and study more intensively, qualitatively and quantitatively. Think of it as a progress report and prospectus for future work you *could* do.

In this assignment, you need to:

- draw upon at least four of the major tools introduced in the social science track

- provide at least two visualizations of different sorts, e.g. a network graph and a bar plot, or an especially well done table

- use at least one feature of one of our key python packages (`pandas`, `networkx`, `scikit-learn` etc.) that we did *not* cover in class. For example, we didn't talk about the cluster functions in `networkx` for analyzing graphs, or the "groupby" method in `pandas`. Look at the "examples" in the documentation of these packages for inspiration on additional things they can help you with!


The major tools are:

- making API calls using `requests` or any other library
- using pandas for numerical data analysis (or other sorts of data analysis)
- vectorizing texts and cosine similarity
- topic modeling
- networks
- geolocation and geoplotting

You can make use of the sentiment analysis from the extra credit if you'd like. 


If you've not found a data set that inspires you, do not hesitate to use materials such as the wide range of materials available from the Sunlight Foundation APIs or the Old Bailey records available through APIs. 

For inspiration and data sets, check out http://www.visualizing.org/. For people showing off various visualizations, check out https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful -- quite variable in quality.


What your project should include:

- Data Set Description

Briefly describe your dataset: its provenance, its URL (if any), how it was collected (or how you collected it), limitations it has or may have.

- Data Wrangling

What did you have to do to clean up and prepare the dataset for further analysis. We introduced `pandas` precisely to make this less painful for you. Did you call upon any other data sets to supplement your own?

Some of you may need to do a lot of work here, others less so.

- Exploratory work using our tools (and those from the rest of the course)

Here, state some of your findings and then show how you came to them (say 150 words or so and the relevant graphs or other ways of illustratting your findings, such as tables).

Then, include your well documented code about how you came to these findings.

- Ways forward 

Write another 150-200 words: What would these results suggest was worth exploring in more depth, either with computational tools or any other form of more traditional qualitative research? What additional data would you like to have? What sort of analysis would you like to perform but don't yet know how to? What are the real limitations of your data set and the tools you have at hand? What methodologies from other classes, if any, would you want to use? If you're unsatisfied with the results, say why!


You should submit your homework as an ipython notebook with graphs. For the expository sections, convert the cells from "code" to "markdown," which is a form of plain text by pressing control-m then m when you are editing a cell, or by using the menus.
